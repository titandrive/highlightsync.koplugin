# 📚 HighlightSync Plugin for KOReader

**HighlightSync** is a plugin for [KOReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader) that **synchronizes and merges your highlights, notes, and bookmarks** across multiple devices or cloud backup locations. It allows you to sync highlights made offline on two or more devices, ensuring that no data is lost when syncing.

Supports popular cloud services like **WebDAV** and **Dropbox**, helping you keep your annotations consistent no matter which device you’re reading on.

## 📥 Installation

To install the plugin:

1. Download the **latest release** from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gitalexcampos/koreader-Highlight-Sync/releases).
2. **Extract the downloaded file** and locate the `highlightsync.koplugin` folder.
3. Copy the `highlightsync.koplugin` folder.
4. Place it inside the `koreader/plugins/` directory on your KOReader device.

## 🔧 Setup

1. Open KOReader.
2. Go to the **Main Menu > Tools > Highlight Sync > Sync Cloud**.
3. Set up your **cloud service** (WebDAV or Dropbox).
4. Select the **folder** where your **JSON files** containing the highlights of your books are or will be stored. (This folder **does not need** to be the same as your ebooks folder.)
   ⚠️ **If you change this folder after you’ve already synced a book**, you **must manually move the book's JSON file** from the old folder to the new one in your cloud service. If the plugin doesn’t find the file in the new location, it will assume that the highlights were **deleted on another device** and will remove them during sync.
5. Configure your preferred **Automatic Sync** settings (Open, Close, or Resume) in the settings menu, or use the manual **Sync Highlights** button.

## ⚠️ Important Configuration Notes

### 📂 Hash-based Metadata (Sidecar Folder)
If you use KOReader's **"Hash based"** setting for metadata location (instead of the default sidecar folder next to the file), the plugin will generate the sync filename based on that hash (e.g., `c5a2f1...json`) instead of the book title.

**Crucial:** You must ensure **ALL your devices use the same metadata setting**.
* If Device A uses **Hash-based** and Device B uses **File location**, Device A will look for a hashed filename while Device B looks for the book title filename. They will **not** see each other's highlights.

### ⏳ Sync Freeze & Refresh
During synchronization, you might experience a **brief freeze** (UI blocking) for a few seconds.
* This is normal behavior due to KOReader's single-core architecture handling the network request and JSON processing.
* After syncing, the plugin refreshes the current view in place so newly imported highlights appear without closing and reopening the book.

## 🛠 Known Limitations

- The **book names** (or hashes, if configured) on the devices must be **exactly the same** for syncing to work correctly.
- If two highlights start at the same position but end at different ones, the **most recent one is kept**.
- This is an early version — feedback is welcome!
